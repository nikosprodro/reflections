What happens when yo initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  You need to initialize a repository in order to add it under git
control and start using it with the git versioning system.
When initializing a repository a hidden git directory is created
which holds all the information about the versions and status of the
files within that repository. As one would expect there are no commits in a newly created repository, and the files of that repository need to be added to git by using the "git add" command before starting commiting them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is the intermediate area between the working
directory and the repository, files are added to the staging area
before committing them to the repository.
  The staging area helps keep track of the files that are to be
committed to the repository, you can keep a new file safely in your working directory and only added in the staging area when it is ready to be committed.
