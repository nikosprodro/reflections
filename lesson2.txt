What happens when yo initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  You need to initialize a repository in order to add it under git
control and start using it with the git versioning system.
When initializing a repository a hidden git directory is created
which holds all the information about the versions and status of the
files within that repository. As one would expect there are no commits in a newly created repository, and the files of that repository need to be added to git by using the "git add" command before starting commiting them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is the intermediate area between the working
directory and the repository, files are added to the staging area
before being committed to the repository.
  The staging area helps keep track of the changes (and files) that are to be committed to the repository, you can keep a new file ior new code safely in your working directory and only add it in the staging area when it is ready to be committed.

How can you use the staging ara to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

  Even if you have worked on many parts of your project in your
working directory and have many "logical" changes to commit you can add them to the staging area and commit them one-by-one thus keeping your commits clean and with meaningfull messages.
