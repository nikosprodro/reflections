When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

  Using a remote repository is preferable when you have to work from many
different physical computers during the course of the project, or when
colaborating with people and all of them need access to the code (to
both push and pull), another reason to use a remote repository is if you
want to share your projects with the world and maybe also let other
developers you do not know contribute to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It is better to have control of what code exists in your local repository so as not to get mixed with other peoples code, this might confuse you (if a new functionality is added in what you are wotking on) or even create confilcts
